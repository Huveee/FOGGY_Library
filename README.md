## System Domain

FOGGY is a virtual library application. With this application, you can 
search for books, complete the borrowing process after making a reservation for a 
specific period, and also view the books you liked.

There are two types of registered users in the system: customers and 
administrators. Our customers can easily borrow the books they want. They can see 
the books they borrowed in the past and the dates on which these books were
borrowed. With user-friendly interface features, our library system aims to provide 
readers with a more personalized book experience.

An administrator can log into the system with a registered username and 
password. They can view customer information, and impose necessary restrictions on 
their accounts.

The system should check the availability of books in the library and
reservation information to prevent double borrowings, conflicts on reservation
dates, and multiple reservations for the same book on the same date.
